  * Using < and > in the conditionals rather than >= and <= will
    be more efficient in situations where there are lots of duplicate
    values.

  * Thorough testing should also include at least:
	  * one case where all numbers are the same.
	  * cases where largest/smallest are first/last.
	  
  * The test methods should have more informative names and
    more informative failure messages from the runTest method.
    The given methods are named testSample1 because they correspond
    to the sample input from the problem.

  * Thorough testing should also include at least:
	  * one case where the result rounds off to .x0 or .00 
	    to test the output formatting.
	  * one case where there is only one line of input values.
