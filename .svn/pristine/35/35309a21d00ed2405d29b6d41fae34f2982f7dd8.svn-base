  3 / 3	-	Code Quality

  2 / 3	-	Documentation/Readability
  * Good line level comments!
  
  * There should be a class level JavaDoc comment indicating partners,
    assignment, data and a high level explanation of the approach being
    used to solve the problem.
     
  * For complete information about expectations for documentation 
    and readability see:
      * Lab #1 - section on "Documenting Code" at the end.
      * The "General Lab Information" document linked on the 
        course home page.
        
  2.5 / 3	-	Testing Quality

  * Looks like a nice comprehensive set of tests.
  
  * The test methods should have more informative names and
    more informative failure messages from the runTest method.
    The methods that I gave were named something like "testSample1"
    because they correspond to the sample input(s) from the problem.
    The names you chose should be descriptive of what is being tested.
    See the list of test names in the rubric above for some examples,
    those are the names of the tests in my suite of reference tests
    that were run against your solution.
    
  * Each test should contain a block comment explaining the purpose of the test.
    Some of the later tests do and that is very helpful in understanding what
    you are testing in each test.
